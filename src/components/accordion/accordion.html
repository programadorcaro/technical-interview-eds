            What is numerical aperture (NA), and why is it important in
            microscope objectives?
          </div>
          <div>
            Numerical aperture is a measure of an objective's ability to gather
            light and resolve fine details. A higher NA means the lens can
            capture more light from the specimen and distinguish smaller
            features, leading to brighter images and higher resolution. In
            practice, objectives with larger NA values enable you to see finer
            structural details than lower-NA lenses.

          <div>
            What is chromatic aberration, and how do apochromat objectives
            correct it?
          </div>
          <div>
            Chromatic aberration is a focusing error where different wavelengths
            of light do not converge at the same point, causing color fringing
            in the image. Standard achromatic objectives correct this for two
            colors (typically red and blue), but some color blur can remain.
            Apochromatic objectives are engineered to bring three colors (red,
            green, blue) into a common focus, virtually eliminating chromatic
            aberration for a color-accurate, sharp image. Olympus plan
            apochromat lenses leverage this high degree of correction to produce
            images free of color halos even in multicolor fluorescence
            experiments.

          <div>
            What's the difference between achromat, fluorite (semi-apochromat),
            and apochromat objectives?
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              These terms refer to the level of optical correction in objective
              lenses.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Achromat lenses are the most common and are corrected for
                chromatic aberration at two wavelengths (usually red and blue)
                and for spherical aberration in one color.
              </li>
              <li>
                Fluorite (semi-apochromat) objectives use special glass
                (fluorite) to achieve better correction—typically bringing more
                colors into focus and improving spherical aberration, resulting
                in higher contrast and often a higher NA than achromats.
              </li>
              <li>
                Apochromat objectives are the most highly corrected, bringing
                three or more wavelengths into focus and correcting spherical
                aberrations in multiple colors. They offer the best image
                quality and usually have the highest numerical apertures.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In short, achromats are cost-effective for routine use, fluorites
              offer a good balance of performance and cost, and apochromats
              deliver the best resolution and color fidelity for demanding
              applications.

        <div>
          <div>
            What does "plan" mean in objective names (such as plan achromat or
            plan apochromat)?
          </div>
          <div>
            Plan designates a flat-field objective, meaning it is corrected to
            produce a flat, in-focus image across the entire field of view.
            Without this correction, the image periphery would be out of focus
            when the center is in focus. Plan objectives eliminate curvature of
            field, so even the edges of the view are sharper. For example, the
            Olympus MPLN series (plan achromat) objectives are designed to
            provide optimal flatness throughout the field for uniform clarity.
            This is especially important for digital imaging or widefield
            eyepieces where a non-plan lens would show blurry edges.

            What are Olympus MPLAPON and MPLAPON-Oil objectives, and when should
            I use each one?
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Olympus <strong>MPLAPON</strong> series comprises high-end
              plan apochromat objectives designed for use in air. These dry
              objectives are known for their excellent color correction and
              resolution. They correct chromatic aberrations across a broad
              range of applications and have very high image fidelity, making
              them ideal for observing critical samples in brightfield,
              fluorescence, or DIC observation.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>MPLAPON-Oil</strong> is the oil immersion version of this
              series. It has the same advanced apochromatic optics but uses
              immersion oil to achieve an even higher numerical aperture (NA up
              to 1.45) for enhanced resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use an MPLAPON dry objective lens when you need a lower
              magnification and avoiding immersion oil is important. Switch to
              an MPLAPON-Oil objective lens when you need a higher resolution
              and enhanced brightness (typically at 60X–100X magnification) and
              your sample can be used with immersion oil.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            Why does using immersion oil increase an objective's resolution
            compared to a dry objective?
          </div>
          <div>
            Immersion oil has a higher refractive index (~1.51) than air (1.0),
            which enables the objective to capture light at larger angles. With
            air as the medium, the theoretical maximum NA is 1.0 (since sin 90°
            = 1 and n=1.0). In practice, most high-end dry objectives top out
            around NA 0.95. By using oil between the coverslip and lens, the
            refractive index increases to ~1.51, enabling NA values around
            1.3–1.4. This higher NA dramatically improves resolution because the
            lens gathers more diffracted light from fine details. In short, oil
            immersion lenses can resolve finer details (and produce brighter
            images) than dry lenses of the same magnification.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>Can I use an oil immersion objective without oil?</div>
          <div>
            No, using an oil immersion objective without the specified medium
            degrades performance. Oil immersion objectives are designed so that
            oil (n≈1.51) fills the gap between the coverslip and lens. If you
            use air (with air, n=1.0) or water when an objective is meant for
            oil, the optics will suffer from spherical aberration and loss of
            resolution because the light rays will focus incorrectly.
            Manufacturers strongly advise against using oil objectives with
            water or other mismatched media. Always use the intended medium
            (oil, water, or glycerin, as specified on the objective). Otherwise,
            the image may be blurred and lack the objective's stated resolving
            power.

          <div>
            What is a correction collar on a microscope objective, and when
            should I use it?
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              A correction collar is an adjustable ring on certain
              high-performance objectives that compensates for cover glass
              thickness or immersion medium differences. Many objectives are
              designed for a standard 0.17 mm coverslip thickness (#1.5 cover
              glass). If your coverslip is thicker or thinner than this, or if
              you are imaging into a fluid of different refractive index, it can
              introduce spherical aberration and blur.
            </p>
            <p>
              Objectives with correction collars enable you to tune the lens for
              these variations—the collar mechanically shifts internal lens
              groups to reoptimize focus. By adjusting the correction collar to
              match your exact coverslip thickness, you can prevent image blur
              and aberrations caused by non-standard cover thickness. In
              practice, you simply turn the collar until the image (especially
              at high focus depth) becomes sharpest. Use the correction collar
              whenever your coverslip or sample deviates from the standard 0.17
              mm, such as in live-cell chambers with thicker bottoms, to
              maintain the best image quality.

        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            Why is the 0.17 mm cover glass thickness so important for
            objectives?
          </div>
          <div>
            High-power objectives are calibrated assuming a 0.17 mm coverslip
            (the typical thickness of a #1.5 cover glass). If you use a
            significantly thicker or thinner glass between the objective and
            sample, the light rays will not converge as intended, leading to
            spherical and even chromatic aberrations. This results in blurry or
            distorted images. Many advanced objectives include a correction
            collar to compensate for these aberrations. For objectives without
            one, it is critical to use the recommended coverslip thickness.
            Using the standard 0.17 mm cover glass helps ensure the objective's
            optical design performs optimally, yielding a sharp image and
            correct focus across the field.

          <div>
            Are Evident/Olympus objectives compatible with microscopes from
            other brands?
          </div>
          <div>
            Compatibility is not guaranteed, especially for modern
            infinity-corrected systems. Microscope objectives often use common
            threads (for example, RMS thread is common on many Olympus
            objectives), so you might be able to screw an Olympus objective into
            another brand's nosepiece. However, the optical design can differ:
            infinity-corrected objectives must be used with the proper tube lens
            focal length and corrections. For example, Olympus infinity
            objectives are designed for a 180 mm tube lens, whereas another
            brand may use a 200 mm tube lens; mixing them can change the
            effective magnification and introduce aberrations. Also, not all
            manufacturers use the same thread pitch or parfocal distance for
            high-end objectives. In summary, Evident or Olympus objectives
            should be used on Evident/Olympus microscopes (or those specifically
            designed for them) to achieve the specified performance. Always
            check thread type, tube length, and optical compatibility before
            swapping objectives of different manufacturers.

          <div>
            What factors should I consider when choosing an objective for
            confocal microscopy?
          </div>
          <div>
            Confocal microscopy demands high resolution and efficient light
            gathering, so the primary considerations are high NA and excellent
            optical correction. Choose a high-NA objective (e.g., 60X/1.40 oil
            or 60X/1.20 water) to collect as much fluorescence signal and detail
            as possible. In confocal and other high-magnification techniques, we
            push to the limits of NA to achieve enhanced resolution. Plan
            apochromat objectives are preferred for confocal because they offer
            superior chromatic correction (important when imaging multiple
            fluorescent channels) and a flat field of view. Our Olympus X Line™
            series objectives, for example, combine improved NA, flatness, and
            chromatic aberration correction across 400–1000 nm, which is ideal
            for multicolor confocal imaging. Also consider the working distance
            and immersion medium. For thick specimens or live cells, a water or
            silicone immersion lens can be advantageous to reduce refractive
            index mismatches. For fixed samples on slides, an oil immersion lens
            provides a higher NA and resolution.
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>
            Do I need special objectives for differential interference contrast
            (DIC) microscopy?
          </div>
          <div>
            DIC uses polarized light and Nomarski/Wollaston prisms to create
            contrast. As a result, objectives for DIC should be largely
            strain-free (free of internal birefringence) so they do not disturb
            the polarized light. Unlike phase contrast objectives, DIC
            objectives usually lack built-in rings or special modifications—the
            main requirement is high optical quality and low strain in the
            glass. Our plan objectives (e.g., Olympus UPlan or MPLN series) are
            manufactured to be compatible with DIC. Many are labeled for DIC use
            or simply perform well due to minimal internal stress. Historically,
            "POL" or strain-free versions were sold for polarization microscopy,
            but many modern Olympus apochromat and fluorite objectives are
            sufficiently strain-free for DIC. So you do not need a dedicated DIC
            objective, as you can use a high-quality plan
            achromat/fluorite/apochromat that is known to work with DIC (and
            make sure to use the proper DIC prism slider set for your objective
            magnification).

          <div>
            Which objectives are recommended for live-cell imaging (such as long
            time-lapse microscopy of living cells or tissues)?
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              Live-cell imaging often benefits from specialized immersion
              objectives, particularly water or silicone immersion lenses. These
              objectives have immersion media with refractive indices closer to
              that of live cells (water ~1.33 or silicone oil ~1.40) to minimize
              spherical aberration when imaging into aqueous samples.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our silicone immersion objectives are highly suited for live-cell
              work. Silicone immersion objectives (e.g., Olympus UPLSAPO 60XS
              silicone) have a high NA (around 1.30) and a relatively long
              working distance (~0.3 mm) to image into thick specimens. The main
              advantage of silicone oil is that it does not evaporate or dry out
              at 37 °C (98.6 °F), making long-term time-lapse imaging more
              stable and less maintenance-intensive than water immersion. Water
              immersion objectives (NA ~1.1–1.2) are also used for live cells,
              especially for short-duration imaging, as they naturally match
              cell media. However, water can evaporate or cause focus drift over
              time.
            </p>
            <p>
              For extended live-cell experiments, silicone immersion objectives
              are often the top choice, providing high resolution and brightness
              in native biological conditions without the drawbacks of drying or
              spherical aberration. As a rule, always confirm that your chosen
              objective is compatible with your microscope and that you have the
              appropriate immersion oil or water delivery system for long-term
              use.
